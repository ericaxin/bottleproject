		<p class="explain">
			The concern over the water safety pushes many of us away from tap water and towards purchasing bottled water. This built-in filter purifies tap water and allows consumers to drink from any water fountain without health concerns.
			<br>
			<br>
			The built-in purifier filters out harmful heavy metals, including lead and zinc, as well as chemicals, bacteria and other contaminants. It also reduces the taste and odor of chlorine in tap water.
